## System Overview

The AI-Enhanced Booking Optimization system helps healthcare clinics reduce no-shows, automate patient communications, and gain valuable insights into appointment patterns.

- **Automated Reminders**: SMS, email, and chat notifications
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Visual analytics and insights
- **PIPEDA Compliance**: Privacy-focused data handling
- **Multi-clinic Support**: Scalable for various practices

## Getting Started

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env`
   - Update configuration values
   - Set up Twilio and SendGrid credentials

3. **Initialize Database**
   ```bash
   python app.py --init-db
   ```

## Understanding AI Predictions

### How the AI Works
The system analyzes multiple factors to predict no-show probability:

**Patient Factors:**
- Previous no-show history
- Appointment frequency
- Demographics and patterns

**Appointment Factors:**
- Booking lead time (how far in advance)
- Day of week and time
- Appointment type
- Weather conditions

**Risk Levels:**
- **Low Risk** (< 10%): Standard reminders
- **Medium Risk** (10-25%): Enhanced reminders
- **High Risk** (> 25%): Multiple reminders + phone calls

### Interpreting Predictions

**Probability Score**: Shows the likelihood of a no-show (0-100%)

**Risk Level**: Color-coded indicator
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Low risk
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Medium risk  
- ðŸ”´ Red: High risk

**Recommended Actions**: Specific steps to reduce no-show risk

### Using Predictions Effectively

1. **Review High-Risk Appointments Daily**
   - Check the dashboard each morning
   - Focus on red-highlighted appointments

2. **Take Proactive Action**
   - Send additional reminders
   - Call patients directly
   - Offer rescheduling options

3. **Monitor Trends**
   - Track prediction accuracy over time
   - Adjust strategies based on results

## Managing Reminders

### Automated Reminder Schedule
The system automatically sends reminders at optimal times:

- **72 hours before**: Early email reminder
- **48 hours before**: Standard email reminder  
- **24 hours before**: SMS reminder
- **2 hours before**: Final SMS reminder

### Manual Reminder Management

**Sending Immediate Reminders:**
1. Go to the Appointments section
2. Find the appointment
